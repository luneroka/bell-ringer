          development more interactive and enjoyable. <br />
          Whether youâ€™re on your own or with a partner, you can choose a topic,
          enable shuffle mode, and test your knowledge through questions created
          to help you progress.

          The idea behind Bell Ringer is simple: to offer a user-friendly tool
          suited for both pair revisions (your partner quizzes you) and solo
